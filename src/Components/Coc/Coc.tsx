                Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage
                when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel
                uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely
                bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a
                participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event
                organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
                warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If
                you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone
                else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
                member of the event staff immediately.
